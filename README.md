# Matrix Discord Chat - React/Next/TypeScript
The idea behind this exercise is to create a Discord like application with the Matrix theme.

## About the "ts-ignore" in the code
You will probably find a lot of comments like this, at least in the first couple of commits, because the Skynex UI components lack of types.
Every @ts-ignore in the code will turn into a Issue and hopefully a Pull Request to resolve these missing types at the Skynex UI components once the training week is over.

Clone this repository. You will need ```node``` and ```yarn``` installed.

Installation:
```sh
yarn install
```

To Run the App:
```sh
yarn run dev
```
